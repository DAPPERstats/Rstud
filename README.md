## Rstud: R interface for studbooks

Rstud is a package of R functions for reading, analyzing, graphing, editing,
and saving studbook-style data.

### Status

The Rstud package is currently in development and should be considered 
provisional at this time. Current tasks are focused on editing an old code
block for working as a clean R package. 

### File-Type Support

Rstud is currently coded to read from and write to PopLink-style SQL studbooks.
Future versions will incorporate additional input file types.

### R Installation

Install the `devtools` package and then run:

```
install_github("DAPPERstats/Rstud")
```

### Author, Development, and Support History

The original Rstud code was written during 2013 - 2015 by J. L. Simonis while
working as a Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Scientist at the Lincoln Park Zoo
in Chicago, IL. The code base was developed primarily to facilitate 
pedigree-based inbreeding analyses from studbooks, but was expanded to address
other pedigree-based analyses as needed.
The current Rstud code and package are being written by J. L. Simonis while
working as a Freelance Scientist for DAPPER Stats.
